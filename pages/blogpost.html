        <h5>1. <u>The History:</u></h5>
        <br />
        <p class="content">
          Mughal history is one of the most fascinating in the world. The Taj
          Mahal is reminiscent of the Mughal era as it was built by Mughal
          Emperor Shah Jahan back in the 17th century. It provides testimony to
          the grand royalty and luxurious lifestyle of the Mughals. A visit to
          the Taj Mahal takes you back in time to that magical era giving your
          mind a virtual break from the current times.

        <h5>2. <u>The Architecture:</u></h5>
        <br />
        <p class="content">
          The Taj Mahal is a brilliant piece of Mughal architecture more than
          anything else. It is simply one of the most stunning monuments ever
          built. It is built completely of semi-translucent white marble and
          took 22 years for completion. You will see why it took this long when
          you notice the details of the marvelous, grand structure with an open
          mouth and an amazed heart.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5>3. <u>The Glamour:</u></h5>

        <p class="content">
          The Taj Mahal has been showcased in several movies in India and in
          Hollywood. The beauty of the Taj Mahal adds so much to every frame
          that you cannot help but wonder what it would be like to be there.
          Watching your favorite stars dancing or strolling around the Taj Mahal
          adds to its glamour quotient.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5>4. <u>Wonder of the World and World Heritage Site:</u></h5>
        <br />
        <p class="content">
          The Taj Mahal has been part of several lists of important places in
          the world – the seven wonders being one of them. It has also been
          recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. You wouldn’t want to miss
          out seeing such a monument when you are in the country that holds it.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5>5. <u>The Epitome of Love:</u></h5>
        <br />
        <p class="content">
          Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal for his second wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who
          died in 1631 whilst giving birth to their fourteenth child. All the
          effort, time and excellence involved in building this beautiful
          monument resulted out of the feeling of love that the Emperor had for
          his wife. When you stand in front on the Taj Mahal with this in mind,
          you begin to experience an emotion close to the Emperor’s love itself.
